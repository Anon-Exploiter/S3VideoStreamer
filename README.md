Playing videos through S3 buckets (Wasabi, AWS, etc.) through client-side VideoJS player without incurring ingress/egree traffic on EC2 Instance.

#### Why?

Found **plex** as a solution, you've to install it, do local syncing using SSH tunnel, login with an account, create a local sync between the S3 bucket and the server hosting the solution. Plex also first downloads those files at server-side and then passes those to the user, **this incurs both ingress and egress traffic cost**. Other than that, **S3 costs for downloading as well.**

This script simply just establishes a connection with the bucket, lists objects and then plays the video at client-side (rather than downloading on server-side first). So no ingress/egress cost for the application on EC2 server! Just the `S3 bucket` as desired! 

### Tested On (OS & Python version)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS -- Python 3.8.5
- Windows 10 -- Python 3.9.5
- WSL [Ubuntu 20.04] -- Python 3.8.5

### Downloading & Installation

Fill in the [config.json](https://github.com/Anon-Exploiter/S3VideoStreamer/blob/main/config.json) file before running the script! 

```csharp
git clone https://github.com/Anon-Exploiter/S3VideoStreamer/ && \
  cd S3VideoStreamer/ && \
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt && \
  python3 app.py runserver
```

### Todos
- Add `authentication` for public hosting
- Add public usage with `--no-sign-method` equivalent so public buckets can be used
- Make the application dynamic so bucket name and other information can be filled directly without `config`

### Note
Make sure you know what service you're using and what it costs! **AWS S3 costs a lot for transfer!!!** Go with `Wasabi` or some other `S3 service`. 

### Filing Bugs/Contribution
